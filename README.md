Kanvas Niche is a set of headless modules designed to optimize the development of headless apps. Our solution provides graph APIs for common problems encountered during development, allowing you to focus on building your product instead of worrying about the backend infrastructure.

Kanvas Niche is not a replacement for your existing backend-as-a-service or development framework. Instead, it complements them by providing specific modules for common problems that you would otherwise need to develop yourself. 

We call it Niche because we focus on specific solutions for common problems, including:

- Ecosystem (authentication, teams, company)
- Inventory: products, variants, distribution channels
- Social: follows, comments, reactions, messaging
- CRM: leads, deals, pipelines
- Workflow: connecting your app with others

With Kanvas Niche, you can install our ecosystem in your workspace and optimize the development of headless apps with faster development times and more reliable performance without having to rewrite existing backend code.

To get started, check out our documentation and installation instructions. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to get in touch with our team.

3. Get inside the php container using ```docker exec -it php bash```.

4. Use the command ```php artisan migrate``` to migrate all kanvas migrations file.

5. Use the command ```php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder```  to seed the database with an app, role and default system modules.

6. Generate app keys `php artisan key:generate` 

7. To check if the API is working just make a GET request to  ```http://localhost:80/v1/``` and see if the response returns ```"Woot Kanvas"```

## Running the project with Laravel Octane

After doing all the steps above, you could run the project with Laravel Octane by using the command ```php artisan octane:start --port 8080 --host=0.0.0.0```. 

Use `--watch` in development allowing you to refresh modified files , this works assuming to have `npm install chokidar` installed in the project.
****
Note: 
- To install Swoole you can use the command ```pecl install swoole``` 
- For production remove `--watch` from the command.
- roles_kanvas_legacy will be deleted in the future.
