Originating from our agency background, we've catered to clients with unique requirements. Over time, we realized we were repeatedly solving the same challenges: whether it was crafting a full-fledged solution, integrating with existing systems, enhancing inventory connectivity, offering agent portals for CRM expansion, introducing social interactions to headless sites, or establishing workflows for seamless system integration.

## **Enter Kanvas:**
Born from the need to streamline these repetitive tasks, Kanvas Niche offers a set of headless modules tailored to accelerate the development of headless applications.

At the same time providing a flexible admin interface to manage all these features.
